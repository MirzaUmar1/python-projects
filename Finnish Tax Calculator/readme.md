Some say paying taxes makes Finns happy, so let's see if the secret of happiness lies in one of the taxes set out in Finnish tax code.


According to the Finnish Tax Administration, a gift is a transfer of property to another person against no compensation or payment. If the total value of the gifts you receive from the same donor in the course of 3 years is €5,000 or more, you must pay gift tax.


When the gift is received from a close relative or a family member, the amount of tax to be paid is determined by the following table:

Value = 5 000 — 25 000	
Tax at the lower limit = 100	
Tax rate for the exceeding = 8%

Value = 25000 — 55000	
Tax at the lower limit = 1700	
Tax rate for the exceeding = 10%

Value = 55000 — 200000	
Tax at the lower limit = 4700	
Tax rate for the exceeding = 12%

Value = 200000 — 1000000	
Tax at the lower limit = 22100	
Tax rate for the exceeding = 15%

Value = 1000000 - onwards	
Tax at the lower limit = 142100	
Tax rate for the exceeding = 17%


So, for a gift of 6 000 euros the recipient pays a tax of 180 euros (100 + (6 000 - 5 000) * 0.08). Similarly, for a gift of 75 000 euros the recipient pays a tax of 7 100 euros (4 700 + (75 000 - 55 000) * 0.12).
